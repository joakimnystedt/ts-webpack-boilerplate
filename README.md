# typescript-webpack-boilerplate

## description
Very simple boilerplate for typescript with webpack. Try to use as few npm packages as possible, to build and serve.

## npm scripts
- `npm run start // this will start a local development server and host on localhost:8080`
- `npm run build-dev // this will build a development version and put it into dist catalog`
- `npm run build-prd // this will build a production version and put it into dist catalog`

## package.json
```
"devDependencies": {
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^5.5.0",
    "ts-loader": "^9.2.6",
    "typescript": "^4.5.5",
    "webpack": "^5.68.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.9.2",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^4.7.4"
  }
```
