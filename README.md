# typescript-webpack-boilerplate

## description
Very simple boilerplate for typescript with webpack. Try to use as few npm packages as possible, to build and serve.

## npm scripts
- `npm run start // this will start a local development server and host on localhost:8080`
- `npm run build-dev // this will build a development version and put it into dist catalog`
- `npm run build-prd // this will build a production version and put it into dist catalog`
